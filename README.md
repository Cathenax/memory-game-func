# Memory Game-func by Siyuan Liu
This project is for the NEU CS5010 project 2:  Functional Programming.  
Memory Game is a type of card game where the player's objective is to find matching pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time.The cards are initially arranged face-down, and the player needs to remember the position of different cards as they flip them over in pairs.   
In this version I’m going to implement a functional program using React with hooks, not using classes. Also, I’ll make big changes to the style of the game (making it prettier), add animations when the card flips, adjust the size of the game board and add a box shadow when user hover the cursor on the card.
